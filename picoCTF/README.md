# picoCTF

> picoCTF is a free computer security game targeted at middle and high school students, created by security experts at Carnegie Mellon University. The game consists of a series of challenges centered around a unique storyline where participants must reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt, or do whatever it takes to solve the challenge.

[picoCTF](https://picoctf.com/) was the first CTF that I attempted. It is designed to teach computer security to complete noobs. I discovered this CTF by watching [LiveOverflow](https://liveoverflow.com/) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/LiveOverflowCTF) videos.


## Educational Resources
The [educational resources](https://picoctf.com/resources) page is a very good reference to get started with this game.
